d3_rebuildable_tree
===================

I make a D3.js tree for navigating hierarchy with several topics.

Each node gets topic that is directed to another topic.
If you click any node, the tree is reorganized with the node at the top.
And if you click the label, you can change the data itself attached to the node and label.
The data is provided with JSON that makes you easy to supply. If you know Graphviz, you can notice it has a similar structure.

Just try it on the web.
