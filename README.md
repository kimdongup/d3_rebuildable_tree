d3_rebuildable_tree
===================

I make a D3.js tree for navigating hierarchy with several topics.

Each node gets topic that is directed to another topic.
If you click any node, the tree is reorganized with the node at the top.
And if you click the label, you can change the data itself attached to the node and label.

Just try on the web.
